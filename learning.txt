I've learnt quite a lot of concepts partaining version control with git and github. However, I did encounter a challenge
when it came to cloning my remote repo to my local machine. I was trying to use the SSH key
but I was getting this error:

ssh: Could not resolve hostname git: Name or service not known
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.

Possible reasons for the error
Incorrect Hostname
SSH Configuration
Network Connection
DNS Resolution
Firewall or Proxy

How I fixed it:
I turned of my proxy and hotspotted my laptop using my phone
I then cloned the repo using the HTTPS method instead of SSH. I used the following command:

 git clone git@github.com:Kenyai402/MyFirstRepo.git
