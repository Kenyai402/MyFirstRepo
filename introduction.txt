 Brief Introduction About Myself 
Hi, I’m Keren Irungu — a passionate software engineering student, tech explorer, and all-around creative soul based in Nairobi, Kenya. 
I’m on a mission to not only understand the digital world but to shape it intentionally, one project, one line of code, and one bold idea at a time. 
My journey so far has woven through web development, blockchain, sustainability, leadership, and art — each thread adding depth to who I am becoming: a purposeful, multidimensional woman determined to make a difference.

Beyond the code, I’m an avid learner, singer, artist, and personal growth enthusiast. 
I see technology not just as a career path, but as a tool for transformation — in communities, in individuals, and in the way we connect. 
I believe in curiosity, in rising again and again, and in building a life that reflects both vision and heart. This is just the beginning.
