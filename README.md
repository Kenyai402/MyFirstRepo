ðŸŒ± Personal Goals (2026)

1. Master Self-Discipline & Time Management

â†’ Journaling daily, attending therapy or support groups if needed, regular spiritual reflection, and developing emotional resilience.

7. Develop Soft Skills Intentionally
â†’ Communication, conflict resolution, emotional intelligence, leadership â€” through practice, mentorship, and real-life situations.


8. Strengthen Your Digital Personal Brand
â†’ Build your blog, post on LinkedIn monthly, maintain a personal portfolio, and tell your story through content.


9. Deepen Relationships & Build a Strong Support System
â†’ More intentional check-ins with loved ones, choosing healthy friendships, and letting go of draining ones.


10. Be Kinder to Yourself
â†’ Speak to yourself with the same gentleness you give others. Progress over perfection, always.
